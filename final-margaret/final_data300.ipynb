    "For this final, we will be fitting two classification models - Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Random Forest classifier on one dataset. We will tweak some parameters and compare the performance of models across parameters and how well they perform on the data. This is your chance to make some design choices on your models and how you work with data. Have fun with it! \n",
