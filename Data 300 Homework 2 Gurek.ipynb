One real world application is the use of time series forecasting to predict future daily sales in retail stores, I work in retail and we are given a sales goal every day and every hour that is based on past data from days in past years, past seasons, etc. A second example would be the forecasting the weather, we know what the typical seasons look like from past years so we use that to predict what the weather will be like in the coming months."

    "6. a. This equation would be an example of an ARMA model, which uses the combination of past observations and past errors for prediction. The c and ùúñùúè terms are the equivalence of intercepts, the c being the value with no previous p stamps, and the ùúñùúè being the expected error term at that time. The first summation equation represents the autoregressive(AR) portion of the model, or the part that uses previous p-stamps to predict the current time‚Äôs stamp. The √òi in this equation is the first order autocorrelation coefficient. The second summation represents the Moving average(MA) portion of the model, or the part that uses past errors to predict the current value at time t. The Œ∏i in this equation is the coefficient for the lag number that is used, lag t. The ùúÄt-1 is the first order moving average paramter. Thus this equation would give us the predicted value of X at time t when you use 3 lags of autoregression and 4 lags of moving averages for your prediction.\n",

You decide the AR order by creating a PACF, or Partial Autocorrelation Function plot, this plot lets you decide how many lags to use based on how many points are significant as shown on the plot. If the first and the third points are significant, then you include 3 lags. You decide the MA order by creating an ACF, or Autocorrelation Function plot, this plot functions the same as a PACF plot so the lag order is decided by the amount of significant points in the same way as the AR order with the PACF plot.
